Abstract
A comprehensive snow density model that accounts for the effects of snow temperature, depth, and liquid water is presented.  The model is based on a series of equations developed more than 50 years ago.  They were derived from detailed field and cold room laboratory measurements of density variation and change in response to a broad range of conditions.  Model behavior is presented for snow event deposition densities and for snow density change during the snow season.  The model was tested over three mountain basins in the western US.  Model fitting statistics indicate that for the 13 validation sites where snow density was continuously monitored, the average Nash-Sutcliffe model efficiency was 0.90, with a mean bias error of 5 kg m-3.  Application of this snow density model increases our confidence in lidar-derived estimates of basin-wide SWE volume.

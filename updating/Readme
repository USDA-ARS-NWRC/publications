Abstract
Accurately simulating the spatiotemporal distribution of mountain snow depths and water equivalent (SWE) improves estimates of available melt water and benefits the water resource management community. In this paper we present the first integration of airborne lidar data into a physics-based snow model using direct insertion. Over four winter seasons (2013â€“2016) the NASA/JPL Airborne Snow Observatory (ASO) has performed near-weekly lidar surveys from the date of peak SWE through melt out to measure high-resolution snow depths over the Tuolumne River Basin above Hetch Hetchy in the Sierra Nevada Mountains of California. The iSnobal model was implemented as part of the ASO program to provide density to convert the ASO-measured depths to SWE, and to provide temporally complete snow cover mass and thermal state between flights. Over the four years considered in this study, snow depths from 39 individual lidar over flights were assimilated into the model to provide updates of snow depth and distribution. Updating the model with the measured values from the ASO program significantly improved the correlation between modeled results before and after updating.  Analyses show that for a single update during the melt season, the correlation between modeled results with and without updating were r2 = 0.92 (RMSE=34mm) and r2 = 0.06 (RMSE=113mm), respectively. The precise definition of the snow depth distribution integrated with the iSnobal model illustrate how the ASO program represents a new paradigm for the measurement and modeling of mountain snowpacks, and the potential benefits for managing water in the region.
